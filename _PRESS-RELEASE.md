There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  Pente

## Sub-Heading ##
  a strategy board game for two players

## Summary ##
  Pente is a strategy board game for two or more players, created in 1977 by Gary Gabrel, a dishwasher at Hideaway Pizza, in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Customers played Pente at Hideaway Pizza on checkerboard tablecloths while waiting for their orders to arrive.

  Pente games are generally short, around 5 to 10 minutes, although they can last longer as the players become more skilled.

## Problem ##
  Strategy board games are often difficult to learn, involving much effort before play can begin.

## Solution ##
  Pente has simple rules and play can begin almost immediately.  However the strategies evolve as the players' skill level grows so Pente games remain engaging over a lifetime.

## Quote from You ##
  This game has been a personal family favorite for decades.  We play it during every extended family gathering, even bringing it with us on vacations.

## How to Get Started ##
  There are two ways to win.  A player can either place five stones in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally), or they can capture five pairs of their opponent's stones.

## Customer Quote ##
  "My teenage son used to play on his phone for all of our family meals and I had a difficult time engaging with him.  Now I can offer to play a game of Pente with him and he can't resist... I get to have quality time with my son again!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  What are you waiting for, grab a partner and go play some Pente!  You could have completed a game by now!
